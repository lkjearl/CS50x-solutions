Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: TODO

On low number stimulations, there are much lesser teams with chance of winning at all; Especially Brazil with a whooping 50% chance of winning when running 10 times.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: TODO

According to the tests, the results got more 'stable' or 'consistent' (comparing to high simulation tries) starting at 100 stimulation.
