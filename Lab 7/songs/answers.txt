I would characterize the listeners aura using an algorythm that takes the danceability, energy, loudness, speechiness valence and tempo of songs that they've listen to.
For example if listener A plays songs of high dancibility, loudness and tempo, we may assume that the listeners may be into EDMs type of music or perphaps with similarity of those played in clubs.
Of course we have to factor in the quantity of the times the songs were played too, since listeners may be just 'exploring' new songs. So a good way could be to only take into account the details of songs that has been played more than 'n' amount of times.
However there are some (or alot) of listeners that like to listen to songs sang by a particular artist, which makes the creation of the algorythm much of a hassle and hard to pinpoint which genre/etc to determine listeners' aura.
I'd suggest taking song's genre into account too because there may be different types of songs that fit into lets say the average of danceability, energy, loudness, speechiness valence and tempo.
